# Authentication

Boilerplate code.  Customize it once Auth code is complete.

> To authenticate, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```ruby
coming soon...
```

```python
coming soon...
```

```javascript
coming soon...
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
